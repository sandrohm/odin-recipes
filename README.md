# odin-recipes
HTML and Git exercise, applying concepts and practices learned with The Odin Project.

In this project, I will create HTML pages with recipes, all linked and presented to the user.

After finishing the project, I learned that I was commiting before saving, so maybe the commit log is confuse. But now I know!
